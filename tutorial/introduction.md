## Introduction

In this tutorial we will be using
the Verilog hardware description language (HDL)
to describe designs for FPGAs.

We will begin by using [Simulation](simulation.md)
to develop designs without requiring any FPGA hardware.

As we explore each design,
we will provide instructions
for deploying them to real hardware
on the [Fomu](fomu.md) and [TinyFPGA-BX](tinyfpga-bx.md) platforms.

Additional [Resources](resources.md) are available for further exploration.
