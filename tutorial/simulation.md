## Simulation

Simulation is a great way to understand how FPGAs operate.
It's is also a critical tool for debugging FPGA designs.

There are several open-source tools that support simulation, but we will use these:
 * [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) for Verilog simulation
   ([User Guide](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/User_Guide))
 * [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for visualizing VCD waveforms
   ([User Guide](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/GTKWAVE))

This tutorial will use simulation
to demonstrate significant FPGA designs
without requiring any FPGA hardware.

All of our projects will be written in Verilog.
The [Wikipedia page for Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)
is a good introduction and overview
of Verilog syntax and semantics.
