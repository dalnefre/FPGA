## Simulation

Simulation is a great way to understand how FPGAs operate.
It's is also a critical tool for debugging FPGA designs.

There are several open-source tools that support simulation, including:
 * [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) for Verilog simulation
   ([User Guide](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/User_Guide))
 * [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for visualizing VCD waveforms
   ([User Guide](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/GTKWAVE))

This tutorial will use simulation
to demonstrate significant FPGA designs
without requiring any FPGA hardware.
