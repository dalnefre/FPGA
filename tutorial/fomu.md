## Fomu platform

![Annotated Hardware](../Fomu/pics/hw-pvt-annotated.png)

[Fomu](https://tomu.im/fomu.html) is a programmable FPGA device that fits inside a USB port.
It has I/O pins, an RGB LED, and an FPGA
that is compatible with a fully open source chain
and capable of running a RISC-V core.
Fomu comes in a custom plastic enclosure that slots perfectly into a USB Type-A port.

Development was [crowd-source funded](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu) in 2019.
A [Fomu Workshop](https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-workshop)
is [published online](https://workshop.fomu.im/en/latest/).

This tutorial uses the Fomu as a deployment target
to demonstrate FPGA design on real hardware.
